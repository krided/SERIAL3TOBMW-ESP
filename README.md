# SERIAL3TOBMW-ESP
This project aims to read real-time data from the Speeduino EFI system using a serial connection and convert that data into CAN messages suitable for BMW E39/E46 instrument clusters. The implementation is designed for the ESP32 WROOM32D microcontroller paired with an MCP2551 CAN transceiver.
